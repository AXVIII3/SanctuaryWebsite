            <div class="skew">
                <p>The world is full of different types of animals. Some of them are friendly and awesome while others are dangerous predators. However, there are places in the world that offer a safe haven for these creatures. A wildlife sanctuary is one such place, designed to protect some of the most endangered and threatened animal species on the planet.  If you love animals and want to support their conservation, a wildlife sanctuary may be just what youâ€™re looking for as a visitor. These sanctuaries tend to focus on specific types of animals or even individual species that need special care and attention outside of the general ecosystem. A wildlife sanctuary offers many benefits to both visitors and the protected animals within its walls. And we, at Flora and Fauna aim to actually make this possible.</p>

            <div class="skew">
                <p>We at Flora and Fauna thrive to make the world a better place for animals. We aim at making a section
                    of the world liveable for the animals in their natural habitats without cages and minimal human
                    interference. Currently we have set up several wildlife reserves in India housing delicate and
                    endangered species from Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. To know more about our reserves and sanctuaries visit the locations page or click on the button below!

            <div class="skew">
                <p>
                    Most of the time it is difficult to protect endangered animals by relocating them as it is tedious
                    and very costly and hence, these animals are protected in their natural environment where they can
                    be monitored and can reproduce and grow in number while being under strict protection of the
                    sanctuary. Biologists and other researchers can also study these animals behaviours and traits by
                    visiting these sanctuaries. And as they are in their natural habitat, they are free to roam and move
                    around without being constrained in a cage.

            <div class="skew">
                <p>
                    Forests are disappearing. There was a time when all we could see around us was trees, and now all we
                    see are buildings. These forests have been cut down to make way for villages, towns and cities. But
                    in these sanctuaries, as it is protected land these forests cannot be cut down, they are preserved
                    and allowed to grow without any barriers. This also helps preserve landforms like hills and
                    mountains, rivers, valleys and waterfalls. As they are protected, they are safe from destruction,
                    development and pollution.

                <p>The forests these sanctuaries occupy are also home to some tribes that have made it their habitat
                    since ages long gone. Tribes like the Saara adivasis in Odisha also play a role in conserving the
                    forests that they live in. By establishing these sanctuaries, the tribes living there are protected
                    as well as they do not have to fight against developers who would otherwise tear down the forest.
                    This also helps in preserving their culture and habits.</p>

                    number has been waning because of human activities. As already mentioned, sanctuaries help in
                    conserving all the biodiversity over an area as it keeps this area free from humans and their
                    activities which could be detrimental to the ecosystem. It is also a type of conservation known as
                    in-situ conservation where the ecosystem is conserved in their natural state and form.</p>

                <p>In wildlife sanctuaries, people are not allowed to go unescorted, that is without a certified guide.
                    Ecotourism is the tourism of ecologically interesting areas to support the conservation of wildlife
                    and observe the wildlife. Here the general public has access to see animals in their natural habitat
                    free of the cages. They get to see animals in their herds, with their young ones and without any
                    fear for their safety. One of the major benefits of ecotourism is that money can be raised by the
                    fees collected for entering the sanctuary. This money can be used in turn to develop the sanctuary.

            <div class="skew">
                <p>The general public is not educated enough about sanctuaries and the benefits they have. But nowadays
                    more and more people are getting educated on sanctuaries and are part of committees that help in
                    uptake of sanctuaries. Celebrities as well help in creating awareness by adopting animals and
                    creating charities on behalf of sanctuaries not only in India but all around the world.</p>
