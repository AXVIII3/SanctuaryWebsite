                    We helped in setting up of 3 minor animal reserves and 2 major multi-species santuaries in India in the year 2022 itself. Each of these house more than 15 different delicate animal species and also provides a home to migratory birds.

                    We had contributed immensely to India's latest Cheetah Reintroduction Project forwarded by our prime minister which included releasing eight Cheetahs, 5 females and 3 males in 2 release points in the Kuno National Park. Earlier cheetas were declared extinct in India in 1952.

                    We had also helped in the realisation of Project Tiger, one of the most successful wildlife conservation ventures which was initiated way back in 1972, has not only contributed to the conservation of tigers but also of the entire ecosystem.

                    We aided the realisation of Project Elephants as well which was initiated in 1992 by the Government of India Project Elephant aims at conserving elephants and their habitat and of migratory routes by developing scientific and planned management measures. Under the project welfare of the domestic elephants is also considered, issues like mitigation of human-elephant conflict are also taken care of. The project’s endeavor is to strengthen the measures for protection of elephants against poachers and unnatural death.

                    One of the saddest stories of the Indian conservation movement is the slow disappearance of the state bird of Rajasthan, the Great Indian Bustard (GIB). It once vied for status as the national bird with the Indian peacock. GIBs were in thousands and could be found all over the Indian subcontinent, except in northeast India and the Himalayas. We alongside the GOI are trying to prevent the bird from extinction.

                    A second home is needed for the lions of Gir National Park to ensure that the last surviving population of Asiatic lions is not wiped out of the subcontinent in the eventuality of any disease or epidemic. As far back as 1994, the WII had identified the Kuno landscape in Sheopur, Madhya Pradesh as an alternate home for the lions. In 2002, a wildlife division across 1,269 sq. km. was created and in 2018 the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary was upgraded to a national park of 748 sq. km. and a buffer of 487 sq. km. We are trying to increase the population of asiatic lions.

                    The human population is increasing day by day, which increases the demand for land and other things. The increasing demand of land cause habitat loss of these animals, which is the major threat to wildlife. We are trying our best to seperate the animals from humans and provide an environment with as little human interference as possible.

                    Poaching can be defined as the illegal trading of animals. It is increasing day by day as they are very expensive and have a high cost in the International market. Some people brought these animals to fulfil their interest. We are giving our best efforts to expose and punish these poachers and protect the animals in the reserves and sanctuaries in our jurisdiction.

                    Pollution is one of the major threats to wildlife. Air pollution, water pollution and another type of pollution are playing a major role in the destruction of habitat and reduce the population of many species of animals. We hope to keep our sanctuaries and wildlife reserves as cleean and non-poluted as possible.

                    Overexploitation can be described as the diminishing of species faster than its recovery. Many animal species are overexploited to meet the need of human beings. This is another major threat to wildlife. We are working to reduce this as much as possible.

They come under ‘endangered’ category now due to the small and fragmented population (c. 1000 mature individuals) as per the assessment of BirdLife International in 2016. Assam and Arunachal Pradesh alone harbours about 50% of its global population with an estimate of 450 individuals.

The main objective of the project is  testing out various initiatives to reduce human-tiger conflict, reduce people’s dependence on forests and spread awareness in the Sundarbans across India and Bangladesh, such that successful measures can be replicated across a larger landscape in a subsequent extension of this project.

                    Through WTI’s Big Idea of Species Recovery alongside Flora and Fauna, the Amphibian Rehabilitation Project will initiate and sustain on ground conservation action to recover the population of threatened amphibians. There are two critically endangered frogs Raorchestes munnarensis and Raorchestes griet that are found only outside PAs. Besides these there are three other critically endangered, two each endangered and vulnerable, six near threatened and seven that are not evaluated, and all of them are endemic. The overall aim of the project is to arrest the decline of at least three threatened Western Ghat amphibian species through a coherent, sustainable program of threat mitigation through strategically planned conservation action, capacity development, and training, advocacy and information sharing implemented by a stakeholder network.
