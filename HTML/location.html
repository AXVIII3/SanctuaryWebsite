                The park includes historical places of note including 17th century forts of the &nbsp;Maratha Empire, &nbsp;Prachitgad &nbsp;and &nbsp;Bhairavgad. Most of the protected area was used an open jail for the "prisoners of war" of the early &nbsp;battles &nbsp;during Chhatrapati &nbsp;Shivaji Maharaj's &nbsp;rule. Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj &nbsp;used Prachitgad as an observation point and recreational place. <br><br>

            <h1>Gir National Park</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, also known as Sasan Gir, is a forest, national park, and wildlife sanctuary &nbsp;near &nbsp;Talala Gir &nbsp;in &nbsp;Gujarat, &nbsp;India. It is located 43 &nbsp;km (27 &nbsp;mi) north-east of Somnath, 65 &nbsp;km (40 &nbsp;mi) south-east of &nbsp;Junagadh &nbsp;and 60 &nbsp;km (37 &nbsp;mi) south-west of &nbsp;Amreli. It was established in 1965 in the erstwhile &nbsp;Nawab of Junagarh's private hunting area, with a total area of 1,412 &nbsp;km2 &nbsp;(545 &nbsp;sq &nbsp;mi), of which 258 &nbsp;km2 &nbsp;(100 &nbsp;sq &nbsp;mi) is fully protected as a national park and 1,153 &nbsp;km2 &nbsp;(445 &nbsp;sq &nbsp;mi) as wildlife sanctuary. &nbsp;It is part of the &nbsp;Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests &nbsp;ecoregion. <br><br> 
                The 14th Asiatic Lion Census 2015 was conducted in May 2015. In 2015, the population was 523 (27% up compared to previous census in 2010). The population was 411 in 2010 and 359 in 2005. The lion population in &nbsp;Junagadh &nbsp;District was 268 individuals, 44 in Gir Somnath District, 174 in Amreli District, and 37 in Bhavangar District. There are 109 males, 201 females and 213 cubs. <br><br>
                In the 19th century, the rulers of &nbsp;Indian princely states &nbsp;used to invite the British colonists for hunting expeditions. At the end of the 19th century, only about a dozen &nbsp;Asiatic lions &nbsp;were left in India, all of them in the Gir Forest, which was part of the &nbsp;Nawab of Junagarh's private hunting grounds. British viceroys brought the drastic decline of the lion population in Gir to the attention of the Nawab of Junagadh, who established the sanctuary. Today, it is the only area in &nbsp;Asia &nbsp;where Asiatic lions occur and is considered one of the most important &nbsp;protected areas &nbsp;in Asia because of its biodiversity.

            <p>
                Jim Corbett National Park &nbsp;is a &nbsp;national park in India &nbsp;located in the &nbsp;Nainital district &nbsp;of &nbsp;Uttarakhand &nbsp;state. The first national park in &nbsp;India, it was established in 1936 during the &nbsp;British Raj &nbsp;and named &nbsp;Hailey National Park &nbsp;after &nbsp;William Malcolm Hailey, a governor of the &nbsp;United Provinces &nbsp;in which it was then located. In 1956, nearly a decade after India's independence, it was renamed &nbsp;Corbett National Park &nbsp;after the hunter and naturalist &nbsp;Jim Corbett, who had played a leading role in its establishment and had died the year before. The park was the first to come under the &nbsp;Project Tiger &nbsp;initiative. <br><br>
                Corbett National Park comprises 520.8 &nbsp;km2 &nbsp;(201.1 &nbsp;sq &nbsp;mi) area of hills, riverine belts, marshy depressions, grasslands and a large lake. The elevation ranges from 1,300 to 4,000 &nbsp;ft (400 to 1,220 &nbsp;m). Winter nights are cold but the days are bright and sunny. It rains from July to September. The park has &nbsp;sub-Himalayan belt &nbsp;geographical and &nbsp;ecological &nbsp;characteristics.[3] &nbsp;Dense moist &nbsp;deciduous forest &nbsp;mainly consists of &nbsp;sal, haldu, &nbsp;peepal, rohini and &nbsp;mango trees. Forest covers almost 73% of the park, while 10% of the area consists of grasslands. It houses around 110 tree species, 50 species of mammals, 580 bird species and 25 reptile species. <br><br>
                An &nbsp;ecotourism &nbsp;destination, &nbsp;the park contains 488 different species of plants and a diverse variety of &nbsp;fauna. &nbsp;The increase in tourist activities, among other problems, continues to present a serious challenge to the park's ecological balance

Located in the &nbsp;Himalayan &nbsp;foothills, it is contiguous with &nbsp;Royal Manas National Park, &nbsp;in &nbsp;Bhutan. The park is known for its rare and endangered endemic wildlife such as the &nbsp;Assam roofed turtle, &nbsp;hispid hare, &nbsp;golden langur &nbsp;and &nbsp;pygmy hog. Manas is famous for its population of the &nbsp;wild water buffalo. <br><br>
                The Manas National Park was declared a sanctuary on 1 October 1928 with an area of 360 &nbsp;km2 &nbsp;(140 &nbsp;sq &nbsp;mi). Manas bio reserve was created in 1973. Prior to the declaration of the sanctuary, it was a reserved forest called Manas R.F. and North Kamrup R.F. It was used by the &nbsp;Cooch Behar royal family &nbsp;and Raja of &nbsp;Gauripur &nbsp;as a hunting reserve. In 1951 and 1955, the area was increased to 391 &nbsp;km2 &nbsp;(151 &nbsp;sq &nbsp;mi). It was declared a &nbsp;World Heritage Site &nbsp;in December 1985 by UNESCO. Kahitama R.F. the Kokilabari R.F. and the Panbari R.F. were added in the year 1990 to form the Manas National Park. <br><br>
                There is only one forest village, Pagrang, in the core of the national park. Apart from this village 56 more villages surround the park. Many more fringe villages are directly or indirectly dependent on the park.The park is divided into three ranges. The western range is based at Panbari, the central at &nbsp;Bansbari &nbsp;near &nbsp;Barpeta Road, and the eastern at Bhuiyapara near &nbsp;Pathsala. Most visitors come to Bansbari and then spend some time inside the forest at Mathanguri on the Manas river at the Bhutan border. <br><br>

                The &nbsp;Sundarbans National Park &nbsp;is a &nbsp;national park, &nbsp;tiger reserve &nbsp;and &nbsp;biosphere reserve &nbsp;in &nbsp;West Bengal, India. It is part of the &nbsp;Sundarbans &nbsp;on the &nbsp;Ganges Delta &nbsp;and adjacent to the Sundarban Reserve Forest in &nbsp;Bangladesh. It is located to south-west of the Bangladesh. The &nbsp;delta &nbsp;is densely covered by &nbsp;mangrove &nbsp;forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the &nbsp;Bengal tiger. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and &nbsp;invertebrate &nbsp;species, including the &nbsp;salt-water crocodile. The present Sundarban National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarban Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a national park. It is a &nbsp;UNESCO World Heritage Site &nbsp;inscribed in 1987.and it has been designated as a &nbsp;Ramsar site &nbsp;since 2019. It is considered as a World Network of Biosphere Reserve (Man and Biosphere Reserve) from 1989. <br><br>
                The first forest management division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869. In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as &nbsp;reserved &nbsp;forests under the Forest Act, 1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the control of the Forest Department. A forest division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarters in &nbsp;Khulna, Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the period 1893–1898.
